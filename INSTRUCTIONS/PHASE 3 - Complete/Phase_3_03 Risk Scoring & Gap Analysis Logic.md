## Part 3: Risk Scoring & Gap Analysis Logic

**Already Implemented in Part 1!**

The risk scoring logic is in `server/src/services/riskScoringService.ts` and integrated into `assessmentService.ts`. Key features:

- **Risk calculation algorithm** (40% priority, 30% implementation, 15% evidence, 15% testing)
- **Risk level determination** (Critical 76-100, High 51-75, Medium 26-50, Low 0-25)
- **Gap description generation**
- **Color coding for UI**

No additional work needed for Part 3 - proceed to UI components.
