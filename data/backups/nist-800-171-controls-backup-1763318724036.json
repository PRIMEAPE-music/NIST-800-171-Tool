The\ndefinition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by\naccount type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in\n03.01.02. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest,\nanonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative\nprivileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible\nfor approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that\norganizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest,\nanonymous, and temporary.\nOrganizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account,\ntype of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing\naccess include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin.\nWhen defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system\nrequirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and\nbusiness requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel\nrequirements).\nUsers who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable\nevidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to\ncause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination\nMay 2024\namong mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource\nmanagers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk\nindividuals.

      "discussionText": "Information flow control regulates where CUI can transit within a system and\nbetween systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and\nwithout regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions\ninclude keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking\nexternal communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the\norganization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web\nproxy server, and limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data\nstructures and content.\nTransferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies\nhow the information flow is enforced (see 03.12.05). Transferring CUI between\nsystems that represent different security domains with different security policies\nintroduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies.\nIn such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated\npolicy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider\nmandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security\npolicies. Enforcement includes prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected\nsystems (i.e., allowing information access only), employing hardware mechanisms to\nenforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading\nmechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.\nOrganizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement\nmechanisms to control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations\n(e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between\ninterconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information\nor the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\nencrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish\nconfiguration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering\ncapability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability\nbased on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\ndocument characteristics).

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment:\norganization-defined frequency].\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure.",
      "discussionText": "Dependence on the products, systems, and services of external providers and the\nnature of the relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to\nan organization. Threat actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, poor manufacturing and\ndevelopment practices in the supply chain, theft, and the insertion of malicious\nsoftware, firmware, and hardware. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic\nwithin a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a complex,\nmultifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization\nto build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external\nstakeholders.\nSupply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing\nrisks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to\ndocument response actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The\nsystem-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy\nimplementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or\nMay 2024\nincorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the management,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM requirements and the development or\nsustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support mission\nand business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and\nwithin organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational,\nand operational contexts.",

      "discussionText": "The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply\nchain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the\nend use of a system or system component, using blind purchases, requiring tamper-\nevident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a\nsupply chain risk assessment can inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are\nmost applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections\nagainst unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of counterfeits, the\ninsertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices\nthroughout the system life cycle.\nOrganizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement\nsafeguards, promote transparency in their processes and security practices, provide\ncontract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit\ncomponents, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations\nconsider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel\nregarding supply chain risks, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs\nshould be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans,\ndocumentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of\nthe organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.",
