The\ndefinition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by\naccount type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in\n03.01.02. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest,\nanonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative\nprivileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible\nfor approving such accounts and privileged access. Types of accounts that\norganizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest,\nanonymous, and temporary.\nOrganizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account,\ntype of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing\naccess include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin.\nWhen defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system\nrequirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and\nbusiness requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel\nrequirements).\nUsers who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable\nevidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to\ncause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination\namong mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource\nmanagers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk\nindividuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles\nmay vary.\nInactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical\naction to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period.\nAutomatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by 03.01.10.",

      "discussionText": "Information flow control regulates where CUI can transit within a system and\nbetween systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and\nwithout regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions\ninclude keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking\nexternal communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the\norganization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web\nproxy server, and limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data\nstructures and content.\nTransferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies\nhow the information flow is enforced (see 03.12.05). Transferring CUI between\nsystems that represent different security domains with different security policies\nintroduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies.\nIn such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated\npolicy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider\nmandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security\npolicies. Enforcement includes prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected\nsystems (i.e., allowing information access only), employing hardware mechanisms to\nenforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading\nmechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.\nOrganizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement\nmechanisms to control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations\n(e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between\ninterconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information\nor the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\nencrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish\nconfiguration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering\ncapability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability\nbased on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\ndocument characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\nfiltering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software\ncomponents) that are critical to information flow enforcement.",

Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors\nthat allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities,\nand/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples\ninclude smart phones, smart watches, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically\nassociated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission\ncapabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or\ndesktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device.\nSome organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices. The\nprotection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require\nusers to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of\ncontrolled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides\nphysical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting\nCUI.\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and\ncapabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of\nsuch devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection\nrequirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device\nidentification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software,\nscanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning\nfor critical software updates and patches, conducting operating system and possibly\nother software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. On mobile\ndevices, secure containers provide software-based data isolation designed to\nsegment enterprise applications and information from personal apps and data.\nContainers may present multiple user interfaces, one of the most common being a\nmobile application that acts as a portal to a suite of business productivity apps, such\nas email, contacts, and calendar.

Malicious code includes viruses, worms,\nTrojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats,\ncontained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as\nsteganography. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software\nand custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other\ntypes of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\nPeriodic scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as\nfiles are downloaded, opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious\ncode protection mechanisms can also monitor systems for anomalous or unexpected\nbehaviors and take appropriate actions.\nMalicious code protection mechanisms include signature- and non-signature-based\ntechnologies. Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial\nintelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the\ncharacteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such\ncode for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not\nbe effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be\nineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures\nwhen it replicates). Non-signature-based mechanisms include reputation-based\ntechnologies. Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and\nsoftware integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code\nexecution.\nIf malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies,\norganizations can rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and\ncontrol, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure\nthat the software only performs intended functions. Organizations may determine\nthat different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code.\nFor example, organizations can define actions to be taken in response to the\ndetection of malicious code during scans, malicious downloads, or malicious activity\nwhen attempting to open or execute files.",
