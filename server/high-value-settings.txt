RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

For each setting above:

1. IDENTIFY THE POLICY TYPE
   - Check the Template field
   - Map to M365 admin portal location

2. FIND A SAMPLE POLICY
   - Use the Sample Policy ID from output
   - Or create a test policy with this setting configured

3. GET THE ACTUAL PROPERTY NAME
   Method A: Graph Explorer
     - Query: GET /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{id}
     - Or: GET /deviceManagement/deviceCompliancePolicies/{id}
     - Look for property names in JSON response

   Method B: Admin Portal + Browser DevTools
     - Open policy in Intune portal
     - Open browser DevTools (F12) > Network tab
     - Edit the policy and save
     - Find the PATCH request and inspect JSON payload

4. VERIFY THE PROPERTY
   - Ensure property exists in policyData
   - Check value type matches expected
   - Test with multiple policies if possible

5. UPDATE THE SPREADSHEET
   - Mark status as "Researched"
   - Record actual property name
   - Add verification notes

STATISTICS
================================================================================

Priority distribution:
  Critical: 24
  High: 26
  Medium: 0

Control coverage:
  Total control mappings: 50
  Unique controls: 15

Template distribution:
  windows10CompliancePolicy                18
  conditionalAccessPolicy                  5
  iosManagedAppProtection                  5
  #settingsCatalog.endpointSecurityDiskEncryption 5
  windows10CustomConfiguration             4
  authorizationPolicy                      3
  #settingsCatalog.baseline                2
  dataLossPreventionPolicy                 2
  iosCompliancePolicy                      1
  androidManagedAppProtection              1

================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPACT
================================================================================

Settings with poor extraction (<50%): 50
Total policy-setting combinations: 1000
Estimated new successful extractions: 700

If you successfully map these 50 settings:
  - Expected match rate improvement: +15-20%
  - Additional controls covered: 15
  - Better compliance accuracy for high-priority controls
